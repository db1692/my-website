      <h2>My work</h2>
      <p>My main piece of work so far has been a personal website for John Higgins. John is an author and speaker, and the website was designed to be a clean and simple focus point for his work. Written from scratch in Atom code editor in around
        two weeks, with Bootstrap elements.

      <h2>My skills</h2>
      <p>My strongest points are HTML and CSS, followed by Javascript. I've also got experience making React apps, creating and maintaining SQL and MongoDB databases, using API's and more. My aim is to become a solid full stack developer, I find
        both front and back end to be equally challening, interesting and satisfying to work with.
